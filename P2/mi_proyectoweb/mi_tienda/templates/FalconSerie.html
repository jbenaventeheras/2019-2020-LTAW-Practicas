     Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit.<br>
     Falcon 9 is the first orbital class rocket capable of reflight. <br>
     Falcon 9 was designed from the ground up for maximum reliability. <br>
     Falcon 9â€™s simple two-stage configuration minimizes the number of separation events -- and with nine first-stage engines, it can safely complete its mission even in the event of an engine shutdown. <br>
